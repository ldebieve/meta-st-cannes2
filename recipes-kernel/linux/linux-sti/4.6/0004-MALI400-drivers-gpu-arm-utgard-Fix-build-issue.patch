Subject: [PATCH 4/5] MALI400: drivers/gpu: arm/utgard: Fix build issue.

The following statement doesn't have consistent behaviour on all machines:
$(wildcard $(src)/linux/license/gpl/*)
On some it actually returns the name of the GPL header file, on others it is a blank string.
Since the driver is in-tree, we can assume GPL compliance.
